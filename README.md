4-Swervos, 1- Big batter pack, 1- Metro board  3 breadboards and one button 

This is a picture of our design, Our plan is to  pick up any chess piece and move it to another location on a chess board we will be using the Materials listed on the paper. 
3-14-24 Today I and Korine did research on what we wanted our code to look like and what we wanted our design to look like 


April: Had a lot going on towards the end of the month.


May: starting to get back into the swing of things and coming to class.

march 5: added the screws to the robot arm, made sure that the pipe goes up and down before added the thing that are listed in numbers. 
march 5: Before adding the base and the rest of the robot arm here is the plane picture of the robot arm.

# description
I was tasked with creating a robot arm that can move up and down using a button. It's equipped with four servos that control its movement. This arm is designed for visual demonstration, so it's best to observe its operation without the need for hands-on interaction.

# Reflection 

When I look back at when I started building my robot arm, I realize it's been a mix of challenges getting it done. The phases Keira and I had to tackle were very interesting we had to dive deep into designs and coding structures, which was both exciting and a bit difficult. This project is about how are we going to get the long pole in the middle to move by using four servos. In order to complete this task we are using a button to control the up and down motion without using our hands. The metro & breadboard really put a lot of power onto the pole. Looking at the completed robot arm (In onshape), I'm proud of what we've accomplished even though we couldnâ€™t get it done in time to print out.
