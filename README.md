4-Swervos, 1- Big batter pack, 1- Metro board  3 breadboards and one button 

This is a picture of our design, Our plan is to  pick up any chess piece and move it to another location on a chess board we will be using the Materials listed on the paper. 
3-14-24 Today I and Korine did research on what we wanted our code to look like and what we wanted our design to look like 


April: Had a lot going on towards the end of the month.


May: starting to get back into the swing of things and coming to class.

march 5: added the screws to the robot arm, made sure that the pipe goes up and down before added the thing that are listed in numbers. 
march 5: Before adding the base and the rest of the robot arm here is the plane picture of the robot arm.

# reflection 

When I look back at the when i started building my robot arm, I realize it's been a mix of challenges and getting it done. The phase of getting it done, which I tackled with Keira, was really interesting. We had to dive deep into designs and coding structures, which was both exciting and a bit difficult. this project is about how are we going to get the long pole in the middle to move by using four servos. by that happening we are using a button so it can go up and down without using our hands. the metro & breadboard really put a lot of power onto the pole thingy.  Looking at the completed robot arm (In onshape) , I'm proud of what we've accomplished even tho we couldnâ€™t get it done in time to print out.
